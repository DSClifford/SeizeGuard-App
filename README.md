#SeizeGuard - Mobile App

This application links via Bluetooth 2.0 to a wearable heart monitor (single-lead) and continuously collects ECG data, performing real-time analysis to predict epileptic event onset. This affords the user critical time to get themselves into a safe position to prevent injury, or to administer an intervention to prevent/ease the event. Propietary prediction algorithms have been removed, but the application is still functional for demonstration purposes.
